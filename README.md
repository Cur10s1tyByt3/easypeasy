# EasyPeasy [Original GitLab Repository: https://gitlab.com/snuggy/easypeasy]

Just a GitHub mirror repository of the latest EasyPeasy (that's hosted in GitLab) (even includes complete uncut *easypeasy-v2.mp3* and *easypeasy_en.pdf*), adapting *Allen Carr's EasyWay to Stop Smoking* for porn addiction.

It's written in R Markdown and compiled using Bookdown.

[Here is a video on how to use RStudio and Git to edit the hackbook.]() NOT YET, SOON

From now on, for minor contributions, you can either create a Gitlab account and edit the R Markdown files directly on the original repo or just edit them and contribute in this repository since it's the latest repo version at the time of uploading over here. However, for major changes, you'll probably want to download R Studio and compile it to make sure everything works well.

Versions are numbered using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).
