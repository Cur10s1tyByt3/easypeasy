From now on, for minor contributions, you can either create a Gitlab account and edit the R Markdown files directly on the original repo or just edit them and contribute in this repository since it's the latest repo version at the time of uploading over here. However, for major changes, you'll probably want to download R Studio and compile it to make sure everything works well.
